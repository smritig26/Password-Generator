# Password-Generator
This Password Generator is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can slide to select the desired password length and check boxes to include uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers. By clicking the "Generate Password" button, a password is created and displayed. The project features a visual indicator (a circle) to represent password strength and includes a copy button for easy copying of the generated password.
